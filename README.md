# C4\_200M Synthetic Dataset for Grammatical Error Correction

This dataset contains synthetic training data for grammatical error correction described in [our BEA 2021 paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.bea-1.4/). Only the corruption edits are published here. To generate the parallel training data you will need to obtain the [C4 corpus](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) and apply the edits by following the instructions below.
